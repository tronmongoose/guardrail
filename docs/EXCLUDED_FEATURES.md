# Excluded Features (v1)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

- **Video remix/re-edit** — No video editing, trimming, or re-encoding. Programs reference YouTube videos as-is.
- **Community features** — No comments, forums, or learner-to-learner interaction.
- **Cohort UI** — The Cohort model exists in the schema but is not wired to any UI or logic.
- **Advanced pacing** — Only `drip_by_week` is implemented. `unlock_on_completion` and cohort-based start dates are future work.
